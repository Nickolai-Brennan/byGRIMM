This plugin tries to turn up the heat on some prose

Select at least 15 up to 5,000 words in a doc in prose

This is also really useful for Beats
(you need to copy your beats into a doc to select them)

You spice up your beats and then when you run the prose, it gets even spicier

If you're unsure of the structure of your beats -
try 🏗️ Structured Beats on the beats first
- then fix them
then use ❤️‍🔥 Add Heat to add heat to those beats
- then fix them again
then run prose generation

Unfiltered prose will go XXX really quick
It will also dive down deep into the XXX - possibly ignoring direct instructions a bit
If you'd rather stick more to your beats
- try Best Prose or Most Accurate for a few strides
and then switch to Unfiltered prose for the hottest strides
(and be prepared to fix it a lot after)

Fixing prose after every paused stride will give you the best results in future chapter stride prose generation
